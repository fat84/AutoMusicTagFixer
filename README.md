what does it do?
- From every file you have in your smartphone, it generates an audio fingerprint, then connects to a ACR server and donwloads the correct data for current song, later allows to correct the song with this downloaded information, in other words, it allows to make a Shazam-like recognition but not from audio recorded, over the audiofiles you have instead and correct them.

What does it offer?
- Automatic correction to your audio files (mp3 files only for now).
- It will be totally free(if license of ACR service allows me), open source and ad free. You can fork it and modified. Just give me the credits for the base code.
